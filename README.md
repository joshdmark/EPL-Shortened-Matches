# EPL Shortened Matches 

## How would the EPL league standings look if the games were only 75 minutes long?

### Takeaways & Observations 
1. If matches were only 75 minutes, Top 5 would be completely unchanged. 

2. Biggest movers DOWN: Wolverhampton 6 --> 14, Newcastle 13 --> 20 

3. Biggest movers UP: Watford 17 --> 12, Everton 12 --> 8

4. Liverpool has been dominant in the final 15 minutes of 1H. (+16 GD, 18 GF, 2 GA)

5. Wolverhamption would fall out of the Champions League race with shortened matches. Current GD with 90' matches: +7 (-9 in first 60', +16 in final 30').
	- Currently in 6th, would be 14th with 75' matches, bottom of table with 60' matches.

#### Note: This analysis makes an assumption that matches would end at the 75' or 60' mark. Results would of course differ if accounting for stoppage time, plus end of match adjustments.
